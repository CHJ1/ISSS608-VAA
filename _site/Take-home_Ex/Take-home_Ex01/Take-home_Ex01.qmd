# Problem Statement

I am assuming the role of a graphical editor of a media company, and I am tasked to prepare at most three data visualisation for the article.

# Objectives of the Article

In my Article, I would like to achieve the following objectives:<br>
<br>
1. To get an overview of the demographic structures and distribution of Singapore Residents in 2024.<br>
2. To find out the area(s) with the highest population of elderly and make recommendations for these area(s).

# Data Source

Dataset, Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024, will be used for this article. The dataset can be found here: https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data

# Below outlines the steps to achieve the following visualisations.

# 1. Load Packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(plotly, tidyverse, ggplot2, scales, dplyr, crosstalk, htmltools) 
```

# 2. Import and Read Data

```{r}
data <- read_csv("data/respopagesex2024.csv")
glimpse(data)
```
# 3. Create a Bar Chart of Population by Age Group and Sex

```{r}
# Create age groups and summarise the data
data <- data %>%

# Analysis 1

The total resident population in Singapore in 2024 was 4,193,530, comprising 2,041,480 males and 2,152,050 females.

The majority of the population was concentrated in the 30 to 69 age range. A significant decline in population was observed from age 70 onwards. As such, further analysis will focus on this age group in the subsequent visualisations to identify where the elderly population is concentrated in Singapore. This will help support appropriate measures and resource planning to ensure they can age gracefully.

A noticeable drop in population was also observed for those aged 30 and below. This suggests that Singapore is experiencing a declining birth rate and is likely to face the challenges of an ageing society in the years ahead. Therefore, long-term resource planning to support the elderly population will be increasingly crucial.

# 4. Create a Bar Chart of Population Age 70 and Above by Planning Area

```{r}
# Filter for Age Group 70 and above
age70plus_data <- data %>%
  filter(
    (Age == "90_and_Over") |
    (suppressWarnings(as.numeric(Age)) >= 70)
  )
```

```{r}
# Summarise population 70 and above by PA
pa_70plus_summary <- age70plus_data %>%
  group_by(PA) %>%
  summarise(pop_over_70 = sum(Pop), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(pop_over_70))
```

```{r}
# Calculate total population age 70 and above
total_pop_over_70 <- sum(pa_70plus_summary$pop_over_70, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Plot using ggplot with custom tooltip text
p2 <- ggplot(pa_70plus_summary, aes(
  x = reorder(PA, -pop_over_70),
  y = pop_over_70,
  text = paste0("PA: ", PA, "<br>Population Over 70: ", comma(pop_over_70))

    y = "Population 70 and Above"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}
# Convert to Plotly with custom tooltip
p2_plotly <- ggplotly(p2, tooltip = "text")
```

```{r}
# Add annotation for total population 70 and Above
p2_plotly <- p2_plotly %>%
  layout(
    annotations = list(
      list(
        x = 0.95,
        y = 1,
        xref = "paper",
        yref = "paper",
        text = paste0("Total Population 70 and Above: ", comma(total_pop_over_70)),
        showarrow = FALSE,
        align = "left",
        font = list(size = 10)
      )
    )
  )
```

```{r}
# Show the plot
p2_plotly
```

# Analysis 2

A bar chart of the population aged 70 and above by planning area was plotted to visualise where the elderly are concentrated in Singapore. According to the visualisation, the total elderly population is 490,160, with 42,430 residing in Bedok. This makes Bedok the planning area with the highest elderly population in Singapore. The bar chart also shows that the number of elderly in Bedok is significantly higher compared to other areas.

In the subsequent visualisation, we will further investigate which subzone(s) within Bedok have a higher concentration of elderly residents. This will help guide our analysis on where resources for elderly support should be prioritised.

# 5. Create a Bar Chart of Population Age 70 and Above in Bedok Subzones

```{r}
# Filter for PA = "Bedok" and Age Group 70 and above
bedok_data <- data %>%
  filter(
    PA == "Bedok" &
    (Age == "90_and_Over" | suppressWarnings(as.numeric(Age)) >= 70)
  )
```

```{r}
# Summarise population 70 and above by SZ (subzone)
bedok_70plus_summary <- bedok_data %>%
  group_by(SZ) %>%
  summarise(pop_over_70 = sum(Pop), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(pop_over_70))
```

```{r}
# Total population 70 and Above in Bedok
total_bedok_70plus <- sum(bedok_70plus_summary$pop_over_70)
total_label <- paste0("Total Population 70 and Above in Bedok: ", comma(total_bedok_70plus))
```

```{r}
# Offset for text above bars
offset <- max(bedok_70plus_summary$pop_over_70) * 0.02
```

```{r}
# Create ggplot
p3 <- ggplot(bedok_70plus_summary, aes(x = reorder(SZ, -pop_over_70), y = pop_over_70)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkblue") +
  geom_text(aes(y = pop_over_70 + offset, label = comma(pop_over_70)), size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Population Age 70 and Above in Bedok Subzones",
    x = "Subzone (SZ)",
    y = "Population 70 and Above"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma, expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}
# Convert to plotly
p3_plotly <- ggplotly(p3, tooltip = NULL)
```

```{r}
# Add annotation
p3_plotly <- p3_plotly %>%
  layout(annotations = list(
    list(
      x = 0.98,  
      y = 0.98,  
      text = total_label,
      xref = "paper",
      yref = "paper",
      showarrow = FALSE,
      font = list(size = 12, color = "black"),
      align = "right"
    )
  ))
```

```{r}
# Show the plot
p3_plotly
```

# Analysis 3

In this visualisation, we observe that Bedok has 42,430 residents aged 70 and above. Among its subzones, Bedok North has the highest elderly population at 13,390, which is significantly higher than the next highest subzone, Bedok South, with 8,310 elderly residents.

# Recommendations

1. Prioritise Elderly-Centric Infrastructure in High Concentration Areas<br>
<br>
Given that Bedok, especially Bedok North, has the highest number of elderly residents, urban planning efforts should prioritise the development and maintenance of elderly-friendly infrastructure. This includes sheltered walkways, wheelchair-accessible paths, more seating areas, and easy access to healthcare facilities, parks, and public transport.<br>
<br>
2. Increase Community-Based Elderly Support Services in Bedok<br>
<br>
Community centres and eldercare services in Bedok should be expanded or enhanced to meet growing needs. Initiatives such as senior activity centres, home care services, and volunteer companionship programmes can help reduce social isolation and improve mental and physical well-being.<br>
<br>
3. Tailor Resource Allocation Based on Subzone-Level Demographics<br>
<br>
With significant variation in elderly population across subzones, policies and resource planning should be localised. Subzones with higher elderly concentrations should receive proportionately more support in terms of medical services, emergency response readiness, and community engagement initiatives.

# Further Studies

1. Living Arrangements of the Elderly<br>
<br>
Understanding whether elderly residents live alone, with family, or in eldercare facilities can help in designing appropriate support systems. For instance, those living alone may require more home care or outreach services.<br>
<br>
2. Access to Healthcare and Amenities<br>
<br>
Conduct spatial analysis to assess proximity of elderly residents to clinics, hospitals, eldercare centres, and public amenities. This will highlight service gaps in areas with high elderly populations but poor access to essential services.<br>
<br>
3. Future Population Projections<br>
<br>
Include population ageing projections at the subzone level to understand where elderly population is expected to rise most in the coming 5–10 years. This helps in long-term infrastructure planning.<br>

# Conclusion

The ageing trend in Singapore is evident, with a significant proportion of residents aged 70 and above, particularly concentrated in planning areas like Bedok. Within Bedok, subzones such as Bedok North house the highest elderly populations, indicating a clear need for targeted support. To ensure that Singapore's elderly can age with dignity and comfort, planning must prioritise elderly-friendly infrastructure, expand community-based services, and allocate resources based on subzone-level needs. Further studies into living arrangements, healthcare access, and future demographic trends will be essential to guide long-term, sustainable planning.
